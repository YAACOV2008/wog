<h3>Level 1: Getting Started </h3>

Welcome to the World of Games: The Epic Journey! This guide will walk you through the
initial steps to set up and run your Python program. Follow the instructions below to embark on your coding adventure.

<h3> Level 2: Game Modules </h3>

Guess Game:
The Guess Game module is designed to initiate a new game by generating a random number
within a specified range of 0 to a variable named difficulty. The game involves receiving a number
input from the player based on the provided properties.

Currency Roulette Game:
The Currency Roulette Game module utilizes a free currency API(package) to retrieve the current
exchange rate from USD to ILS (Israeli Shekel). Players are tasked with guessing the value of a newly
generated random number (between 1 to 100) in USD converted to ILS. The accuracy of their guess
depends on the game's difficulty level.

Memory Game:
The Memory Game module aims to challenge players' memory by displaying a sequence of
random numbers (for example if the difficulty is 3 the random numbers can be: 100, 15, 80) for a
brief duration (0.7 seconds) and then prompting them to recall and input the displayed numbers.
The objective is to determine whether the player's input matches the original sequence.
